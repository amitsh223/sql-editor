# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Link to the application (https://amitsh223.github.io/sql-editor/)
The given task was given by Atlan. According to the task I have to build an online editor which enables user to run SQL queries. 

#  Features

 - [ ] **Tab Based Interface**: Allows user to easily switch between multiple queries . Each tab maintains its own state so while you switch the tabs state will still there as soon as you reload the page.
 - [ ] **History**: This application keeps the tack of queries that was ran by the user in order to track them easily what queries user have ran till now.
 - [ ] **Schema**: Schema of the tables is provided such that user can easily view the schema of the table and it will also help the user analyze the table structure.
 - [ ] **Dependencies**: - Minimal dependencies have been used for the creation of the page. I have used MUI dependency in order to fast forward the creation.
 - [ ] **Statement with Queries**:- I have given the English statement such that if the user have difficulty in understanding SQL queries. He/She can get better understanding from the statement.
 - [ ] **Table Data**:- Data of the tables is also there in the table tab such that user can able to see the data of the tables in order to get the better understanding of table structure.


## Problem Statement
- [ ] Create, design and implement a web-based application capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query. The application must include a space which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application..
- [ ] Your application must have more than one query accompanied by its corresponding table of data. You can have a predefined set of queries and a predefined set of tables showing some data. You must also provide a way for us to toggle between these queries and choose any query and view the table of data accompanying it. It can be a dropdown or any other toggling mechanism.

## Further Enhancements
 - [ ] Search functionality can be added such that user can easily filter out the data. 
 - [ ] Export CSV can be there such that user can able to download the data based on the query result.
 - [ ] Sorting can also be implemented such that user can also able to sort the data or can apply different filters.





## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
